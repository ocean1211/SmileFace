Paper executável desenvolvido na disciplina IA369Z - Reprodutibilidade em Pesquisa Computacional - FEEC - Unicamp

In this article, we present a comparison between two Machine Learning techniques for smiles classifiers: The K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine.The classifiers will be integrated into JoyFace to stop the wheelchair movements.
The JoyFace is a system based on Computer Vision developed to control a wheelchair through facial expressions. This Human Machine Interface considers the displacement of the user’s face relative to a reference region.The face is identified by a regular webcam and verify the face positions. Each position is associated with a movement control of the wheelchair.
