# JoyFace - Facial expressions for controlling a wheelchair
Paper execut√°vel desenvolvido na disciplina IA369Z - Reprodutibilidade em Pesquisa Computacional - FEEC - Unicamp

In this work, we proposes the development of a human-computer interaction based on computer vision called JoyFace. It features a solution for people with motor disabilities such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident among others. It allows using a front camera already existing in most devices and controlling them through expressions or facial movements.A wheelchair simulation has also been developed and can be tested in real time on this executable paper.
